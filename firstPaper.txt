                       Abstract:
Data analytics is useful for prediction from more information and it helps  medical  centre  to  predict 
 of  various  disease.  Huge amount of patient related data is maintained on monthly basis.
 The  stored  data  can be  useful  for  source of  predicting  the occurrence  of future  disease. 
 Some of  the data  mining  and machine  learning  techniques  are  used  to  predict  the  heart disease, 
 such as  Artificial Neural  Network (ANN), Decision tree, Fuzzy Logic, K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN), Na√Øve Bayes 
 and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
			
							INTRODUCTION
	
 Common attributes  used for  heart  disease  are Age, Sex,  Fasting  Blood  Pressure,  Chest  Pain  type, 
 Resting ECG(test  that measures  the  electrical activity  of the  heart), Number  of  major  vessels  colored  by
 fluoroscopy,  Threst Blood  Pressure  (high  blood  pressure),  Serum  Cholestrol (determine  the  risk  for  
 developing  heart  disease),  Thalach (maximum heart rate achieved), ST  depression (finding on an electrocardiogram, 
 trace in the ST segment is abnormally low below  the  baseline),  painloc  (chest  pain  location  (substernal=1,  otherwise=0)), 
 Fasting  blood  sugar, Exang (exercise included angina),
 smoke, Hypertension, Food habits, weight, height and  obesity[4].
					  
					  LITERATURE REVIEW

K.  Polaraju et  al, proposed Prediction  of Heart  Disease using Multiple Regression  Model and it proves 
that  Multiple Linear Regression is appropriate for  predicting heart disease chance. The work is performed using 
training data set consists of  3000  instances  with  13  different  attributes  which  has mentioned earlier.
 The data set is divided into two parts that is 70%  of  the  data  are  used  for  training  and  30%  used
 for testing. Based on the results,it is clear that the classification accuracy of Regression algorithm is better compared to other algorithms.
